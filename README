Basic agent to control analyses on remote hosts over SSH:

Requirements:
- tracevisor host/user can access the remote host via SSH with a shared key
  with no password
- lttng-sessiond is started as root on the target machine
- the remote user is root or in tracing group

To start an I/O analysis on host "localhost" as user "julien" for 2 seconds:
curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"host":"localhost", "duration":2, "type":"io", "username":"julien"}' http://localhost:5000/trace/api/v1.0/analyses

The request only returns when the trace is completed.
