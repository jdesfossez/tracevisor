Basic agent to control analyses on remote hosts over SSH:

Requirements:
- python3-flask
- tracevisor host/user can access the remote host via SSH with a shared key
  with no password
- lttng-sessiond is started as root on the target machine
- the remote user is root or in tracing group

To start an I/O analysis on host "localhost" as user "root" for 2 seconds:
curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"host":"localhost", "duration":2, "type":"io", "username":"root"}' http://localhost:5000/trace/api/v1.0/analyses
Complete param list: host, duration, type, username, relay, analysis, mongohost, mongoport

The request only returns when the trace is completed.

To get the list of supported analyses and the configuration:
curl http://localhost:5000/trace/api/v1.0/analyses

To get the list of servers running tracesd (https://github.com/jdesfossez/tracesd.git) :
curl http://localhost:5000/trace/api/v1.0/clients

To get the public ssh keys of the user that runs tracevisor :
curl http://localhost:5000/trace/api/v1.0/ssh

To list the current running sessions (the status comes from THREAD_*) :
curl http://localhost:5000/trace/api/v1.0/list

To register a relay (fields: hostname, ipv4, ipv6, ctrlport, dataport):
curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"hostname": "myrelayhostname", "ipv6":"fe80::1" }' http://localhost:5000/trace/api/v1.0/relays

To list the relays registered :
curl http://localhost:5000/trace/api/v1.0/relays
[{"ipv6": "fe80::1", "ipv4": "", "ctrlport": 5342, "hostname": "myrelayhostname", "dataport": 5343}]

To delete a relay :
curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X DELETE -d '{"hostname": "myrelayhostname" }' http://localhost:5000/trace/api/v1.0/relays

To register a client (fields: hostname, ipv4, ipv6, sshport, sshuser):
curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"hostname": "myclienthostname", "ipv6":"fe80::1" }' http://localhost:5000/trace/api/v1.0/clients

To delete a client :
curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X DELETE -d '{"hostname": "myclienthostname" }' http://localhost:5000/trace/api/v1.0/clients
